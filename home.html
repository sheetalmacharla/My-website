  <h1>Gaming</h1>



  <p>

    Gaming is my hobby. Games like Dead by Daylight and Marvel Rivals are my favourites.

    Recently I have been playing a lot more story mode games than first person shooters.

    I really like the graphics in the game Where Winds Meet.

    It is my current addiction.
